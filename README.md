# Preparing Data and Visualising with Matplotlib

## About this project
This project's goal was to clean up and combine the data from both 'Mouse_metadata.csv' and 'Study_results.csv', then visualise the data using the Matplotlib in python. This was to understand how to use Matplotlib to visualse complex data sets. This project was broken down into each of these goals:
- Prepare the data.
- Generate summary statistics.
- Create bar charts and pie charts.
- Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
- Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
- Calculate correlation and regression.

Within Analysis&Visualisation.ipynb is split into sections based upon the goals of this project. It also contains analysis on the data provided.

## Using this project
The files used for analysis are located within the 'Resources' folder. The 'Analysis&Visualisation.ipynb' provides an analysis of each listed section and can be seen in browser or within a compatible IDE such as Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebook.

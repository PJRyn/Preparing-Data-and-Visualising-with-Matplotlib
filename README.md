# Preparing Data and Visualising with Matplotlib


## About this project
This project's goal was to provide an analysis of hypothetical pharmaceutical data based on animal testing (this data is not sourced from actual animal testing). To provide a proper analysis of the pharmaceutical data both 'Mouse_metadata.csv' and 'Study_results.csv' were joined and cleaned then Matplotlib was used to visualize the data to illustrate conclusions that could have been drawn from the data. The approach for this project was broken down segmented goals:
- Preparing the data.
- Generating summary statistics.
- Creating bar charts and pie charts.
- Calculating quartiles, finding outliers, and creating a box plot.
- Creating a line plot and a scatter plot.
- Calculating correlation and regression.


This cleaning and analysis was done within the 'Analysis&Visualisation.ipynb' notebook. It follows each of the steps above and provides some conclusions that can be extrapolated from the data set.


## Using this project
The files used for analysis are located within the 'Resources' folder. The 'Analysis&Visualisation.ipynb' provides an analysis of each listed section and can be seen in browser or within a compatible IDE such as Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebook.
